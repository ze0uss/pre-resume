--> I am creating a web app that helps users prepare for interviews by allowing them to upload their resume
as input. The app will use AI to scan the resume for keywords, skills, and projects, and then automatically 
generate relevant interview questions based on that information. This way, users can practice and
improve their interview readiness.

Here's a more detailed outline of the process:

1. User Registration and Resume Upload: Users will need to create an account or sign in to the web app.
   After logging in, they can upload their resume in a supported file format (e.g., PDF, DOC, or TXT).

2. Resume Parsing: The backend of the web app will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to parse the uploaded resume.
    NLP will extract essential information such as skills, qualifications, work experience, education, and projects.

4. Keyword and Skill Identification: The AI component of the app will analyze the parsed resume to identify key skills and relevant keywords.
    This analysis can include both hard skills (e.g., programming languages, tools) and soft skills (e.g., communication, leadership).

5. Question Generation: Based on the identified skills, keywords, and projects, the AI will generate a set of interview questions tailored to the 
   user's profile. These questions will cover various aspects of the user's expertise and experience.

6. Question Repository: To ensure a diverse range of questions, the app can maintain a repository of interview questions categorized by skill sets 
   and job roles. The AI can then draw questions from this repository, which can be expanded and updated over time.

7. User Interface: The front-end of the web app will provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with.
   Users will be able to see their uploaded resume, view the generated interview questions, and possibly save or bookmark questions for future 
   reference

8. Interview Practice: Users can go through the generated questions and practice answering them. The web app can provide options for users to 
   simulate a real interview experience by setting time limits or allowing them to record their responses.

9. Feedback and Improvement: After users practice their interview responses, they can receive feedback on their answers. The app can either use AI- 
   driven analysis or offer peer-to-peer feedback through a community feature.

10. Progress Tracking: The app can track users' progress over time, allowing them to see their improvement and identify areas for further practice 
    and development.

11. Privacy and Security: Since resumes often contain personal information, it's essential to ensure data privacy and security. Implement measures 
    to protect user data and comply with relevant privacy regulations.

12. Continuous Improvement: Regularly update the AI models and algorithms to enhance question generation and improve the accuracy of skill 
    identification.

By following these steps, your web app can become a valuable tool for job seekers, helping them prepare effectively for interviews and increase their chances of landing their desired roles.
